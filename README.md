This project is tic-tac-toe game, finished by following TheOdinProject as I mentioned in description. The game starts in terminal giving user option to take tutorial if someone wouldn't know tic-tac-toe and then he can play with another user on the same pc, typing number from 1-9 in order to place "X" or  "O" in 3x3 squared board, which is displayed before each move.
